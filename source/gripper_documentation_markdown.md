# Tutorial: Interfacing Third Party Grippers with Fetch’s Arm

Fetch offers a modular mobile manipulator platform, capable of completing
a variety of tasks across complex enviorments. Mechanisms such as those present in grippers are the
 physical basis for how a robot interacts with the world.  Grippers offer different utility based
  on their governing mechanism allowing a robot to achieve a desired task.  The Fetch gripper is
   a parallel pincher which offers a wide range of utility, however, there may be instances
    where a different configuration is desirable.  The following tutorial outlines the 
  procedure for interfacing different robot grippers creating a procedural approach for 
  doing this using Fetch’s mechanical, electrical, and software interfaces. After a review
   of systems two specific examples will be presented.

## Mechanical Gripper Interface of Fetch:

The gripper flange has four M6x1.0 thread holes for attaching a gripper to the robot. 
The holes are spaced equally around a 50 mm diameter circle. The bolts should be tightened to 8 N·m,
 making sure there is 8 to 10 mm of threads engaged. For rotational alignment, an optional 6 mm 
 diameter hole is provided for an alignment pin. For accurate centering of mounted tools, the gripper 
 flange’s 6.5 mm high, 63 mm diameter boss can be factored into the tool design. A cable path is provided 
 for optional cable routing.
